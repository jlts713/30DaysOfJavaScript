# About My 30DaysOfJavaScript
This is my 30 Days Of JavaScript Challenge following the [30 Days Of JavaScript Challenge](https://JavaScript30.com) presented by Wes Bos.

You can refer to the origin Wes Bos [JavaScript30 github page](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) to start your own one.

Since I am a die-hard Taylor Swift fan (yah Swifties!), I would try to showcase my love in each of these challenges.
